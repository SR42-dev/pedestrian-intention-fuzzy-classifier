# pedestrian-intention-fuzzy-classifier
A research project repository containing algorithms to classify pedestrian obstruction probabilities into fuzzy logic states using 2D cameras 

### Current week : 4

### Next short-term goal(s) :

- Predict pedestrian positions on frame based on collected data and compare with reality (show the path of the camera and that of the pedestrian intersecting with IRL test video)
    - Last window and future window implementation.
    - Implement 1D kalman filter for all varying values.
    - Hardware implementation (if necessary) & recording of dynamic scenes.
    - Extend algorithm to multiple pedestrians by multithreading
    - Algorithm optimization    
    - Paper writing initialization

- Figure out formulae to get collision probability from obtained variables.
- Draw decision-making automata & fuzzy logic map for collision prediction.
