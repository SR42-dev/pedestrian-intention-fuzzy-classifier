# pedestrian-intention-fuzzy-classifier
A research project repository containing algorithms to classify pedestrian obstruction probabilities into fuzzy logic states using 2D cameras 

### Current week : 5+
#### Deadline : 18-July-2022

### Next short-term goal(s) :

- View visualizing path of the pedestrian and the path of the robot (show intersection) [DONE]
- Display predicted outcome in the previous implementation [DONE]
- Document the code and all it's functions & underlying algorithms (mention the three programs and their outputs in the new README) [DONE]
- Write setup instructions in README.md and transfer current contents to another README.md under ./resources/generalInformation [DONE]
- Mention descriptions of fuzzy states in the documentation
- Figure out a project title
    - Keywords : fuzzy state classification, kalman filter, pose detection, quaternions, ML pipeline, 2D cameras (eliminating the requirement of depth perception), latency, computational load, autonomous robots
    - Title : Low Latency Pedestrian Path Prediction & Intention Classification using Kalman Filtered Quaternion based Pose Estimation 
- Record a singular testing scene and plug path in all three source code variations

Notes to take the project further :
- Paper writing : focus on performance analysis using more videos from online
- Hardware implementation (if necessary) & recording of dynamic scenes
- Extend algorithm to multiple pedestrians by multithreading
