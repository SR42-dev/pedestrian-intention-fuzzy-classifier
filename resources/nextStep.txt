Predict pedestrian positions on frame based on collected data and compare with reality.

Extend algorithm to multiple pedestrians & collect data (angle of approach, speed, displacement etc.).

Figure out formulae to get collision probability from obtained variables.

Draw decision making automata & fuzzy logic map for collision prediction.
