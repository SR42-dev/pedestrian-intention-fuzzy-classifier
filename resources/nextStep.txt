Predict pedestrian positions on frame based on collected data and compare with reality (show the path of the camera and that of the pedestrian intersecting with IRL test video)

Predict if there will be a collision in the case of the intersecting path.

Extend algorithm to multiple pedestrians & collect data (angle of approach, speed, displacement etc.).

Figure out formulae to get collision probability from obtained variables.

Draw decision making automata & fuzzy logic map for collision prediction.
