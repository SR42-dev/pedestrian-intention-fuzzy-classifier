Predict pedestrian positions on frame based on collected data and compare with reality (show the path of the camera and that of the pedestrian intersecting with IRL test video)
- hardcode overlay and visualize 2D representation of 3D path [DONE]
- implement 1D kalman filter for all varying values
- predict if there will be a collision in the case of the intersecting path.

Figure out formulae to get collision probability from obtained variables.

Draw decision making automata & fuzzy logic map for collision prediction.

Extend algorithm to multiple pedestrians.
